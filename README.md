# TestCases and Software Manual Testing Templates.
Repository where various manual testing ideas based on real-world experience were added

## :loudspeaker: What this is all about?
To help manual testers write manual test cases faster, this repository includes a sample set of test cases. Additionally, it contains templates for test planning and bug bash.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why was this project started?
Writing test cases is a laborious task that consumes the majority of software testing time. Therefore, I made generic test cases for the functionality that is most frequently used in software testing so that anyone can download a copy and use it immediately in their projects and save the time required to write the generic test cases.


## :bulb: The following additional sample test cases and templates:
- Sample Test cases for some common functionality
- Model Test cases for Test Reports.
- General Test Cases for Login Functions.
- Checklist for test planning.
- A sample of a bug.

## :question: Need Help?
Write to me at hasanazeerkhan@gmail.com to discuss your concerns.

## :rocket: Don't forget to give the project a star to increase its popularity.
