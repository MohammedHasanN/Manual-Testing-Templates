## Software bug

An individual's error (mistake) could result in the introduction of a defect (fault or bug) in the software code or in another related work product. In order for developers to prioritise them, we as testers must ensure that we report issues in a proper manner. There are multiple ways to report bugs, and these reporting methods will vary depending on the bug management software we use.
